# Modular Component Architecture

This directory follows Next.js App Router modular architecture principles for optimal component organization and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

### Component Organization
- **`_components/`** - Page-specific modular components (private folder, ignored by Next.js routing)
- **`_components/utils/`** - Business logic and data fetching utilities
- **`components/`** - Legacy global components (to be migrated)

### Design Principles

#### 1. Modular & Pluggable Components
Each component in `_components/` is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Manages its own data and presentation
- **Focused**: Does one thing exceptionally well  
- **Pluggable**: Easy to add/remove from page.tsx
- **Clean interface**: Simple props, clear responsibility

#### 2. Client Component Best Practices
Following Next.js App Router patterns:
- **`'use client'` directive**: Properly marked for client-side interactivity
- **TypeScript integration**: Full type safety with proper event handling
- **Performance optimized**: Strategic use of useEffect and state management
- **Browser API access**: Safe handling of client-only features

#### 3. Component Composition
```typescript
// âœ… PERFECT: Clean page orchestration
// app/page.tsx
import { Hero } from './_components/Hero'
import { Navigation } from './components/Navigation'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navigation />
      <Hero />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Current Components

### Hero.tsx
**Purpose**: Interactive hero section with real-time engagement tracking
**Type**: Client Component (`'use client'`)
**Features**:
- Mouse-responsive background animations
- Real-time metric cycling
- User interaction tracking with rate calculation
- Personalized engagement system
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Key Interactions**:
- Dynamic rate calculation based on user engagement
- Interactive capability cards with hover effects
- Live market intelligence dashboard
- Personalization banner after 5 seconds

## Migration Strategy

### From Legacy to Modular
1. **Identify page-specific components** in `components/` folder
2. **Move to `_components/`** with proper client/server designation
3. **Update imports** in page.tsx to use modular structure
4. **Add TypeScript types** and proper error handling
5. **Test component isolation** and pluggability

### Best Practices for New Components
1. **Plan component boundaries** before implementation
2. **Use context7** to research current Next.js patterns
3. **Document component purpose** and interface
4. **Test modularity** - can it be easily added/removed?
5. **Validate performance** with React DevTools

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Components
1. Create component in `_components/ComponentName.tsx`
2. Add `'use client'` if interactivity is needed
3. Import and use in `page.tsx`
4. Document component purpose and interface
5. Test component isolation and reusability

### Component Guidelines
- **One responsibility per component**
- **Clear prop interfaces**
- **Proper TypeScript typing**
- **Error boundary handling**
- **Performance considerations**

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Reusability**: Modular components can be easily shared
3. **Performance**: Optimal client/server component boundaries
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear file organization and imports
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without complexity

## Next Steps

1. **Migrate remaining components** from `components/` to `_components/`
2. **Add utils folder** for shared business logic
3. **Implement data fetching patterns** with Payload CMS integration
4. **Create component library** documentation
5. **Add testing strategy** for modular components
